- `_loadVitalSigns()` - Load vital signs from Firebase
- `_addVitalReading()` - Add new vital signs reading
- `_getBMICategory()` / `_getBMIColor()` - BMI calculation and color coding
- `_getBPColor()` / `_getSugarColor()` - Health status color coding

### Navigation:
- Added Profile tab to bottom navigation (index 2)
- Updated navigation range to 0-3
- Integrated PatientProfilePage into dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ USER EXPERIENCE
